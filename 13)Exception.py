--What is an Exception?

An Exception is an error that happens during the execution of a program.
Whenever there is an error, Python generates an exception that could be handled.
It basically prevents the program from getting crashed.

---Why use Exceptions?

Many a time, there are valid as well as invalid exceptions.
Exceptions are convenient in many ways for handling errors and
special conditions in a program. When you think that you have a
code which can produce an error, you can use exception handling technique.

----Raising Exceptions in Python:


You can raise an exception in your program by using the raise exception statement.
Raising an exception breaks current code execution and returns the exception back
until it is handled.

--Common Exception Errors

IOError (Input Output Error) – If the file cannot be opened

--ImportError – If Python cannot find the module

--ValueError – Raised when the user hits the
interrupt key (normally ctrl+c or delete)
